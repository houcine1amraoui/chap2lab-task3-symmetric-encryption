# lab2-task3-symmetric-encryption-demo

In the previous task (Task 2), the password has been sent encoded. But attacker still can decode it very easily. In this task, you will get a demonstration of a symmetric data encryption between a client and a server. 

## Project Preparation
1.	Clone or download the code from the following GitHub repo: https://github.com/houcine1amraoui/lab2-task3-symmetric-encryption-demo  
2.	Open the project folder with VS Code.
3.	Open the integrated terminal, “cd” into the “server” folder, then run “npm install” command to install the dependencies used by the server.
4.	Open the integrated terminal, “cd” into the “client” folder, then run “npm install” command to install the dependencies used by the client.
5.	Run the server.

## Questions
1.	Use Burp Suite to intercept the exchanged traffic between the client and the server.
2.	What do you conclude?
